# Book — Training for Building Autonomous Humanoid Robots Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accessibility for Beginners
The content MUST be accessible to beginners while strictly maintaining scientific accuracy.

### II. Step-by-Step Instructional Clarity
Instructions MUST be step-by-step clear, designed for engineering students and developers.

### III. Engaging Content
Content MUST engage readers through storytelling, questions, analogies, and interactive elements.

### IV. Evidence-Based Content
All content MUST be evidence-based, grounded in reputable robotics, AI, and control-systems research.

### V. Zero Plagiarism
All content MUST be original, rewritten, and cited where required, with zero tolerance for plagiarism.

## Writing Standards

### Tone
Scientific, academic, but highly interactive and non-boring.

### Reading Level
Clear for beginners (Flesch-Kincaid grade 8–10).

### Structure
Short paragraphs, hands-on examples, exercises, checklists.

### Visual Diagrams
Include visual diagram descriptions (ASCII, blocks, or step visuals).

### Concept Explanation
Explain complex robotics concepts with real-world references (e.g., Boston Dynamics, Honda ASIMO) and provide analogies to simplify concepts without oversimplifying science.

### Jargon
Avoid jargon unless explained immediately.

## Content and Quality Standards

### Factual Accuracy
All factual statements MUST be accurate and verifiable.

### Sources
Use reputable robotics, AI, control theory, and mechanical engineering sources. Minimum 50% references from peer-reviewed papers, textbooks, or academic publications.

### Real-World Examples
Real-world examples MUST be factual and contemporary.

### Chapter Requirements
Every chapter MUST contain:
- Step-by-step guidance
- One or more diagrams (text-based or described visually)
- Practical exercises or mini-labs or quizez or Do you know . what ever suitable with context
- Beginner-friendly explanations + advanced notes 

### Citation Standards
- Use APA citation style.
- Paraphrase everything → 0% tolerance for plagiarism.
- Include citation list at the end of each major section or chapter.

- Clear, linear progression from beginner fundamentals to advanced humanoid training
- Cover: sensors, perception, locomotion basics, motor control, AI decision systems, simulation tools (ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, Isaac), and vision-language-action systems

- Chapters MUST include:
  - Learning objectives
  - Concept explanation
  - Visual diagram(s)
  - Example or case study
  - Exercise or activity
  - Summary + reflection questions

### Constraints
- Language: English (simple, clear, structured).
- Avoid complex math unless essential; provide beginner explanations.
- No unsafe, harmful, or weapon-related content.
- Focus on education, simulation, non-harmful robotics use-cases.
- Ensure all examples encourage safe, ethical engineering practices.

### Formatting Rules
- Use markdown headings (H1–H4).
- Use bullet lists, tables, timelines, and structured blocks where needed.
- Visual diagrams MUST be readable in plain text.
- Use indentation of two spaces for nested lists.
- Variable or parameter names MUST be descriptive and meaningful.

### Success Criteria
- Beginner can understand key concepts.
- Developer/engineering student can follow step-by-step training.
- All scientific statements are accurate and traceable.
- Includes visual diagrams, real-world references, and interactive elements.
- Original writing with zero plagiarism.
- Clear, engaging, and non-boring throughout.
- Produced content matches academic + beginner-friendly goals.

## Governance
This Constitution supersedes all other project practices. Amendments require a documented proposal, team approval, and a clear migration plan for any affected artifacts. All contributions MUST comply with these principles.
