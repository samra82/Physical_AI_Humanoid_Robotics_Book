# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Specification

- Purpose: Validate that the specification is complete, high-quality, and ready for planning
- Updated: 2025-12-04
- Feature: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## 1. Content Quality — ✔️ Fully Complete

- No implementation details (no coding frameworks, APIs, libraries mentioned)
- Entire spec focuses on student value, clarity, learning outcomes
- Written clearly for beginners + non-technical stakeholders
- All required specification sections are present
- Language is instructional, academic, yet engaging
- Book structure requirements fully explained
- Modules, intros, and outcomes mapped clearly

## 2. Requirement Completeness — ✔️ Everything Satisfied

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- All requirements unambiguous and testable
- Measurable success criteria defined
- Success criteria do NOT depend on any technology
- All acceptance scenarios covered (beginner → advanced flow)
- Edge cases addressed
- (e.g., beginners with no robotics background, ensuring visuals & examples are included)
- Scope clearly defined (Only 4 modules + intro sections)
- Dependencies & assumptions listed
- Students may use simulators
- All modules build progressively
- Requires visual diagrams and step-by-step explanations

## 3. Feature Readiness — ✔️ Ready for /sp.plan

- All functional requirements include clear acceptance criteria
- (e.g., “Must include diagrams”, “Must be non-boring”, “Must be step-by-step”)
- Student scenarios included (beginner pathways, engineering background use)
- Specification meets all measurable learning goals
- Zero implementation leakage — purely conceptual, educational, structural
- Book flow validated:
- Intro → Why Physical AI Matters
- Learning Outcomes
-     Module 1 → ROS2
-     Module 2 → Digital Twin
-     Module 3 → NVIDIA Isaac
-     Module 4 → Vision-Language-Action
