# 1.4 URDF: Describing Humanoid Robot Structure

In the previous chapters, we learned how ROS 2 enables communication between different software components of a robot. However, for a robot to move, sense, or interact with its environment in a simulated or real physical space, the software needs to know its physical properties: its shape, mass, inertia, and how its various parts (links) are connected by joints.

This is where **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)** comes in. URDF is an XML-based file format used in ROS to describe the kinematic and dynamic properties of a robot. It defines the robot's visual appearance, collision properties, and the relationships between its links and joints. For complex systems like humanoid robots, URDF is indispensable for accurate simulation, motion planning, and control.

## What is URDF?

URDF models a robot as a tree-like structure composed of two main elements:

1.  **Links:** Represent the rigid bodies of the robot. These are the physical parts like a torso, an upper arm, a forearm, a hand, a thigh, a shin, a foot, etc. Each link has associated visual, collision, and inertial properties.
    *   **Visual:** Describes how the link looks (e.g., its mesh file, color, texture).
    *   **Collision:** Defines the simplified geometric shape used for collision detection.
    *   **Inertial:** Specifies the mass, center of mass, and inertia tensor, which are crucial for accurate physics simulation.

2.  **Joints:** Represent the connections between links and define their kinematic relationship. Joints describe how links can move relative to each other. Common joint types include:
    *   **`revolute`:** A rotating joint (e.g., elbow, knee, shoulder).
    *   **`prismatic`:** A sliding joint (e.g., linear actuator, telescoping leg).
    *   **`fixed`:** No movement; rigidly attaches two links (e.g., a camera mounted to a head).

Each joint connects a `parent` link to a `child` link and has attributes like its `origin` (position and orientation relative to the parent), `axis` of rotation/translation, and `limit`s (range of motion).

## Why URDF is Crucial for Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots are characterized by their anthropomorphic structure, featuring a complex arrangement of many links and joints that mimic human anatomy. Describing such a robot accurately is vital for several reasons:

*   **Accurate Simulation:** Simulation environments like Gazebo (which we'll cover in Module 2) rely on the URDF to correctly render the robot's appearance and simulate its physical behavior (gravity, collisions, dynamics).
*   **Motion Planning:** AI-based motion planners need the kinematic and dynamic model provided by URDF to calculate feasible and collision-free trajectories for the robot's limbs and body.
*   **Inverse Kinematics (IK):** For humanoid robots, IK is used to determine the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector (e.g., hand or foot) position and orientation. A precise URDF model is fundamental for accurate IK solutions.
*   **Visualization:** Tools like Rviz use URDF to visualize the robot's structure, its sensor data, and planned movements, aiding in debugging and understanding robot behavior.
*   **Hardware Abstraction:** URDF provides a common description that can be used across different software components and even different hardware implementations, offering a layer of abstraction.

## Anatomy of a Humanoid URDF (Conceptual Example)

A humanoid robot's URDF would typically start with a `base_link` (e.g., the torso) and then define joints and links branching out for the head, arms, and legs. Each limb would consist of multiple links (e.g., `upper_arm_link`, `forearm_link`, `hand_link`) connected by `revolute` joints that define the degrees of freedom (DOF).

```xml
<!-- Simplified URDF structure for a humanoid robot -->
<robot name="my_humanoid">

  <!-- Base Link -->
  <link name="base_link">
    <inertial>...</inertial>
    <visual>...</visual>
    <collision>...</collision>
  </link>

  <!-- Neck Joint and Head Link -->
  <joint name="neck_joint" type="revolute">
    <parent link="base_link"/>
    <child link="head_link"/>
    <origin xyz="0 0 0.2" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <axis xyz="0 0 1"/>
    <limit lower="-1.57" upper="1.57" effort="10" velocity="1"/>
  </joint>
  <link name="head_link">...</link>

  <!-- Right Shoulder Joint and Upper Arm Link -->
  <joint name="right_shoulder_pitch_joint" type="revolute">
    <parent link="base_link"/>
    <child link="right_upper_arm_link"/>
    <origin xyz="0 -0.1 0.1" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <axis xyz="0 1 0"/>
    <limit lower="-2.0" upper="2.0" effort="20" velocity="1"/>
  </joint>
  <link name="right_upper_arm_link">...</link>

  <!-- ... further joints and links for arms, torso, legs, etc. ... -->

</robot>
```

*(Note: Real URDF files are much more detailed, including precise inertial properties, collision geometries (often referencing STL files), and comprehensive visual models.)*

Creating a correct and well-structured URDF is often the first step in bringing a humanoid robot to life, whether in simulation or in the real world. It provides the essential physical description that higher-level software components use to understand and control the robot. With this understanding of URDF, we conclude our exploration of ROS 2 and its foundational tools. In the next module, we will dive into creating digital twins and simulating realistic robot environments using Gazebo and Unity.
