# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

![Project Banner](/display.PNG)

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive textbook for teaching **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**, created using:

- **Claude Code** – AI-assisted writing  
- **Spec-Kit Plus** – Specification-driven book creation  
- **MCP Cortex 7** – Modular content planning & management  
- **Docusaurus** – Documentation framework  
- **Mermaid** – Flowchart and diagram generation  

The book bridges the gap between digital AI models and physical robots, teaching students how to simulate, control, and deploy humanoid robots for real-world tasks.

## What This Book Covers

This textbook introduces **Physical AI** and embodied intelligence. It covers:

- Robotic control using **ROS 2**  
- Simulation of humanoid robots in **Gazebo** and **Unity**  
- Advanced AI perception with **NVIDIA Isaac™**  
- Integration of **LLMs** and voice commands for autonomous robots  
- Capstone project: building an autonomous humanoid capable of perception, planning, and interaction
